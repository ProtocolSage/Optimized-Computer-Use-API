# Security Considerations for Computer Use API

This document outlines important security considerations when using the Computer Use API implementation. Since the API gives Claude direct control over your computer, it's important to understand and mitigate potential risks.

## Potential Risks

1. **System Control**
   - Claude has the ability to control mouse and keyboard inputs
   - Claude can execute command-line operations
   - Claude can create, modify, and delete files

2. **Data Exposure**
   - Screenshots may capture sensitive information
   - File operations could expose personal data
   - Command outputs might include private information

3. **System Modification**
   - Commands executed by Claude could modify system settings
   - File operations could alter important system files
   - Applications launched by Claude could make unwanted changes

4. **Prompt Injection**
   - Content on websites or in files might influence Claude's behavior
   - External content could potentially override user instructions

## Recommended Safeguards

### Sandboxed Environment

For maximum security, consider running the Computer Use API in a sandboxed environment:

1. **Virtual Machine**
   - Create a dedicated virtual machine for running the API
   - Limit network access from the virtual machine
   - Use snapshots to easily restore the VM if needed

2. **Limited User Account**
   - Create a dedicated user account with restricted permissions
   - Avoid running the API with administrator privileges
   - Limit access to sensitive directories and files

### Code Modifications

Consider these modifications to the provided implementation:

1. **Command Restrictions**
   ```python
   # Add to CommandTool.__call__
   # List of forbidden commands or command parts
   forbidden = ["format", "del /", "rmdir /s", "rd /s"]
   for item in forbidden:
       if item in command.lower():
           return ToolResult(error=f"Command contains forbidden operation: {item}")
   ```

2. **Path Restrictions**
   ```python
   # Add to FileTool.__call__
   # List of protected directories
   protected_paths = ["C:\\Windows", "C:\\Program Files", "C:\\Users\\Admin"]
   for protected in protected_paths:
       if str(path).startswith(protected):
           return ToolResult(error=f"Access to path {path} is restricted")
   ```

3. **Action Logging**
   ```python
   # Add to ComputerUseAPI class
   def log_action(self, action_type, details):
       """Log all actions taken by the API."""
       timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
       log_entry = f"{timestamp} | {action_type} | {details}\n"
       with open("computer_use_log.txt", "a") as f:
           f.write(log_entry)
   ```

### Human Oversight

1. **Approval Mechanism**
   - Modify the implementation to require human approval for certain actions
   - Example: Ask for confirmation before executing system-modifying commands

   ```python
   # Example implementation for command approval
   async def require_approval(self, action, details):
       """Request human approval before executing sensitive actions."""
       print(f"\n⚠️ APPROVAL REQUIRED ⚠️")
       print(f"Action: {action}")
       print(f"Details: {details}")
       response = input("Approve? (y/n): ").lower()
       return response == 'y'
   ```

2. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Watch the operations as they occur
   - Be ready to intervene if undesired behavior is detected

## Best Practices

1. **Scope Limitation**
   - Give Claude specific, well-defined tasks
   - Avoid open-ended instructions that might lead to unexpected actions

2. **Data Awareness**
   - Close sensitive applications and files before using the API
   - Be mindful of what's visible on screen during screenshots
   - Don't ask Claude to work with sensitive personal information

3. **Regular Auditing**
   - Review logs of Claude's actions
   - Check created/modified files after sessions
   - Monitor system changes

4. **Recovery Plan**
   - Keep backups of important files
   - Know how to revert unwanted changes
   - Have a way to quickly terminate the API if needed

## Implementation-Specific Security Features

The provided optimized implementation includes several built-in safeguards:

1. **Timeout limits** on command execution
2. **Error handling** to prevent crashes from unexpected operations
3. **Path validation** for file operations
4. **Command output capture** to prevent endless processes

## Example: Adding a Security Layer

Here's an example of how to add a security wrapper around the ComputerUseAPI:

```python
class SecureComputerUseAPI(ComputerUseAPI):
    """Adds security features to the ComputerUseAPI."""
    
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        super().__init__(api_key)
        self.log_file = "security_log.txt"
        self.protected_paths = ["C:\\Windows", "C:\\Program Files"]
        self.forbidden_commands = ["format", "del /s", "rmdir /s"]
        self.require_approval_for = ["command", "str_replace"]
        
    async def run_conversation(self, user_message, output_callback, tool_output_callback, api_response_callback):
        """Override to add security logging."""
        self.log_action("CONVERSATION_START", user_message)
        
        # Wrap callbacks to add security checks
        secure_tool_callback = self._secure_tool_callback_wrapper(tool_output_callback)
        
        result = await super().run_conversation(
            user_message,
            output_callback,
            secure_tool_callback,
            api_response_callback
        )
        
        self.log_action("CONVERSATION_END", "")
        return result
        
    def _secure_tool_callback_wrapper(self, original_callback):
        """Wrap the tool callback to add security checks."""
        async def secure_callback(result, tool_id):
            # Security check logic here
            # ...
            
            # Call the original callback if approved
            original_callback(result, tool_id)
            
            # Log the action
            self.log_action("TOOL_USE", f"{tool_id}: {result.output or result.error}")
            
        return secure_callback
        
    def log_action(self, action_type, details):
        """Log all actions for security auditing."""
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        with open(self.log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"{timestamp} | {action_type} | {details}\n")
```

## Final Recommendations

1. **Start Restricted**: Begin with a highly restricted environment and gradually allow more access as you become comfortable with the tool

2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test with harmless tasks before moving to anything that could potentially modify your system

3. **Stay Updated**: Keep the implementation updated as new security considerations emerge

4. **Be Present**: Don't leave the Computer Use API running unattended

Remember that while this implementation aims to be secure, giving any AI system control over your computer carries inherent risks. Always exercise caution and maintain appropriate safeguards.
